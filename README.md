# LSTM-CNN-Stock-Prediction-Model

## Initiative
### Construct and Compare Model Accuracy and Efficiency between 3 Stock Prediction Models

- Basic LSTM
- LSTM Seq2seq
- CNN-Seq2seq

## Project Layout
1. Data Acquisition 
    - Retrieve live data giving stock ticket label
2. Model Construction 
    - Build and tune the model for the above three model methodologies
3. Output Agent 
    - Apply the built model and plot output stock predictions as well as Buy & Sell signaling point
4. Result Analysis 
    - Compare and analyze the performance metrics between the above three models
